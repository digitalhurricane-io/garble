make it so flags can be passed after 'ungarble' command, instead of before it

don't require absolute paths

current example:
garble -log-file /home/paul/Dev/proxyNetworkPro/goObfuscation/obsTest/logA.txt --source-path /home/paul/Dev/proxyNetworkPro/goObfuscation/obsTest -salt GCEEndhrmvOFKtRN2Y3U0VceR1SLLlKEvKVvYd2u0LDy4UkQaT ungarble

make a verbose mode. Normally, don't have it print errors when it can't ungarble something, as
  it should always just be something that was never garbled in the first place.

Add example usage
